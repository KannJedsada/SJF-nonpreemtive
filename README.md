# SJF Nonpreemtive

## Overview

SJF (Shortest Job First) Non-Preemptive Scheduling is a CPU scheduling algorithm that selects the process with the shortest burst time to execute next. This algorithm is a mini-project for the Operating System course, designed to help understand its working principles.

## How It Works

 - The CPU selects the process with the shortest burst time from the ready queue.

 - Once a process starts executing, it cannot be interrupted until it completes.

 - If two processes have the same burst time, FCFS (First Come, First Serve) is used as a tie-breaker.
